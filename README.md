SP for me is tasks of easy and small projects for the purpose of learning. Most often, they are based on Frontend Mentor projects.

I created the project in the BEM methodology using SCSS. I wanted to organize variables etc. as much as possible.



Here's a link to Frontend Mentor where I downloaded the illustrations and got the idea. https://www.frontendmentor.io.
